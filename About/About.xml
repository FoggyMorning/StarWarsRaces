	<description>Adds the Wookiee, Rodian, Twi'lek, Ewok, and Togruta races to the PlayerColony and PlayerTribe factions.  
This makes them available at game start for all scenarios that use those factions. 
Does not add any additional factions.
Additionally all three races can show up as refugees, wanderers, or slaves during game play.  
They will also now show up as part of the Pirate, Outlander, and Tribal factions by default.  You can disable this in the settings.
	
[h1] What's different? [/h1]

- Rodians have the same stats as humans
- Twi'leks ave the same stats as humans
- Wookiees are bigger and tougher than humans
- Ewoks have the same stats as humans, but are smaller than other pawns and always have tribal backstories.
- Togruta have the same stats as humans
	
[h1] Credits [/h1]
Should be compatible with other existing Star Wars mods including any others that add the same species.
Thanks to erdelf for the Alien Race framework!
Thanks to the owners and creators of Star Wars.
